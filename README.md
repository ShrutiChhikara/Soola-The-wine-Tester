# Soola-The-wine-Tester

People today strive to live lavish lifestyles. They often use the items either to flaunt their possessions or on a regular basis. One such item is Wine. Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grape juice.Wine production is a time consuming process. Wine has been there for a long time. A model has been developed using Random Forest Classifier which can indicate the quality of wine as bad or good. This type of prediction can be applied to different other products and makes human work easier.

After collecting the data set, we would process the data. Then we will split the dataset into training and testing data. The dataset would then be passed through the machine learning algorithms. The prediction is then made and the same data is again fed to the model for the training process.

The results are explained using the proportion of properly detected cases, precision, recall, and F measure. A variety of classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNearest Neighbour, and Support Vector Machine are tested on the datasets. According to the research' findings, the Random Forests Algorithm performs better than other classifiers in classification tasks. Up to 92 percent of the time, the Random Forest Algorithm accurately predicts wine quality. We can see that high-quality wines typicallyhave greater alcohol content, higher sulphate content, lower volatile acidity, and higher residual sugar content.
